Design a Twitter Like Service

(1) **Clarify requirements**

Clarifying attributes and goals of a system allows us to focus just on designing those parts. 

- Can users post tweets?
- Should we also design and create the userâ€™s timeline?
- Can users follow other people?
- Do Tweets contain photos and video?
- Will users be able to search tweets?
- Will there be push notifications for tweets?

(2) **Back of the envelope estimations**

Helps later on when the focus is on scaling, partitioning, load balancing and caching.

- What scale is expected from the system? 
- How many new tweets? Number of tweet views? 
- Number of timeline generations per second?
- How much storage is needed?
- What network bandwidth usage are we expecting?

(3) **System interface definitions**

Establishes a contract for the system and verifies that you got the requirements right.
